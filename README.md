# @wawjs/ngx-socket

Angular Socket.IO integration package from Web Art Work.

`ngx-socket` extracts the socket client feature from the older all-in-one package into a focused Angular package.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE)

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save @wawjs/ngx-socket
```

You also need a Socket.IO client factory:

```bash
npm i --save socket.io-client
```

## Usage

```ts
import { provideNgxSocket } from '@wawjs/ngx-socket';
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

export const appConfig = {
	providers: [
		provideNgxSocket({
			socket: {
				url: 'https://api.example.com',
			},
			io,
		}),
	],
};
```

## Socket Service

`SocketService` manages client connection setup and event communication.

Subscriptions registered before the socket connects are attached on connection. Emits made while it is reconnecting are queued and sent once; the service does not create timer-based retry loops.

### Methods

- `setUrl(url: string): void`
- `disconnect(): void`
- `on(to: string, cb?): void`
- `emit(to: string, message: any, room?: any): void`

Example:

```ts
import { SocketService } from '@wawjs/ngx-socket';

constructor(private socketService: SocketService) {}

ngOnInit() {
	this.socketService.on('connect', () => {
		console.log('Connected');
	});

	this.socketService.on('message', message => {
		console.log(message);
	});
}

sendMessage() {
	this.socketService.emit('message', { text: 'Hello world' });
}
```

## Configuration

`provideNgxSocket()` accepts:

- `socket: false` to disable the client
- `socket: true` to connect using the current origin
- `socket: { url?, port?, opts? }` for explicit endpoint/options
- `io` as the raw Socket.IO client factory or module export

## AI Coding Agents

This package includes [AI.md](AI.md) with copyable instructions for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and other coding agents.

Copy this into the consuming project's `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent file:

```md
- This Angular project uses `@wawjs/ngx-socket` for Socket.IO client communication.
- Import public APIs from `@wawjs/ngx-socket`.
- Prefer bootstrapping with `provideNgxSocket({...})` in application providers.
- Put socket URL, port, client options, and the `io` factory in `provideNgxSocket()` instead of scattering connection setup across components.
- Prefer `SocketService` for event subscriptions and emits before introducing another socket abstraction.
- Keep SSR-safe behavior intact. Do not access browser-only socket APIs outside the guarded service flow.
```
